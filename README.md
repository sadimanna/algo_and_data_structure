# Data and File Structure

For displaying images of the Trees or Heaps, a system call to a separate python file has been used, as I don't know how to display images in C.

For generating the images of the graphs or trees, I have used Graphviz, whihch needs to be installed.

Graphviz can be downloaded from here : https://graphviz.gitlab.io/download/

After installation add the **bin** folder to **PATH**.

# Design and Analysis of Algorithms

All the codes work in both Linux and Windows. All the codes are part of assignment of my coursework. I hope the problem statements are clear from the filenames.
